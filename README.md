* For this project I used several features from __Android Jetpack__. 
* For app architecture I used __MVVM__
* To resolve communication between activities, fragments and viewmodels I used __LiveData__ objects (for most cases)
* To populate layouts I used __Databinding__
* To make the Reddit service call I used __Retrofrit__
* To show thumbnail photos I used __Picasso__
* To save read/dismiss I used __Shared preferences__, instead I could have used __Room__ and also be able to save posts in the DB. Didn't used __Room__ to use the time elsewhere
